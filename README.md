# stripe_payment_pwa

Example of how code looks like after implementing stripe payments on PWA studio.

I've added this as a guide for developers that struggle to find good examples, and currently PWA studio lacks good sources.

Is not a work-out-of-the-box solution this is a cut of a working solution implemented by me in the past, use at your own risk.

Files should be adapted to your structure.
